    #### Before Apache 2.4.47
    # RewriteEngine on
    # RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
    # RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} Upgrade [NC]
    # The following configuration is documented but seems not to work
    ### RewriteRule ^(.*) "ws://vaadin:8080/$1" [P,L]
    # For some reason the request path is prefixed with /proxy:http://vaadin:8080
    # Maybe a misconfiguration somewhere?
    # Right now fix by ignoring the prefix
    # RewriteRule ^/?(proxy:http://vaadin:8080/)?(.*) ws://vaadin:8080/$2 [P,L]

    #### Apache 2.4.47+
    ProxyPass         http://vaadin:8080/ upgrade=websocket
    ProxyPassReverse  http://vaadin:8080/
